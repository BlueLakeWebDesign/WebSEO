THis file is a script I created for using the Google Vision API and the OpenAI API to automate creating EXIF data and adding it to photos.

One thing to note when running this script is:

***//// Google Vision API Call

The Google Vision API is being called in the function analyze_image(image_path):

python

def analyze_image(image_path):
    client = get_vision_client()  # This gets the Google Cloud Vision client
    with open(image_path, 'rb') as image_file:
        content = image_file.read()

    image = vision.Image(content=content)  # Image object for the Vision API
    response = client.object_localization(image=image).localized_object_annotations  # Calls the object localization feature

    The function get_vision_client() initializes a client for Google Vision API by calling vision.ImageAnnotatorClient() from the google.cloud library.
    The actual API call is made when client.object_localization(image=image) is invoked, which analyzes the image using object localization and returns the response.

API Keys Handling

The code does not explicitly show where the Google Vision API keys are handled, but typically, the Google Cloud client library uses environment variables to manage authentication credentials. The credentials would normally be set up by defining the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable, which points to a JSON file containing the service account key.

To set up your API keys, you would need to do this before running the script:

bash

export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/your/credentials.json"

This file would contain your Google Vision API key and other necessary credentials. In the code, this setup is assumed to have been done beforehand and isn't explicitly included.
